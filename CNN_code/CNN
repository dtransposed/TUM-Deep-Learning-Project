# Pretrained CNN
Three pretrained CNN arthitectures were tested, namely: VGG11, Resnet16, Densnet161. The final fully connected layer was replaced with a randomly initialized layer. Initially the fully networks were trained, the convolutional part with a lower learning rate, than the final fully connected layer. However, as freezing the weights of parts or the whole of the feature extractor did not result in lower validation scores, the decision was made to only train the final fully connected layer.

The dataset was overfitted with all architectures to make sure they were learning on the dataset. As Densnet161 overfitted in the least amount of epochs, and due to its low number of parameters it was possible to use a bigger batch size, it was decided to choose this as the final model. Then training was done by extracting 5 random frames from each video as training samples. The batch size and learning rate were taken as hyperparameters and were fine-tuned using a training-validation split of 80-20%. Using a testset with the size of 10% of the training set and consisting of videos not included in the training or validation datasets, a final test accuracy of 78.7% was achieved.
